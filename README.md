# Ignite 2019 - A Developers Guid to AI 

 
## Presentation: Making Sense of your Unstructured Data with AI (45 mins)

Tailwind Traders has a lot of legacy data that they’d like their developers to leverage in their apps – from various sources, both structured and unstructured, and including images, forms, pdf files, and several others. In this session, you'll learn how the team used Cognitive Search to make sense of this data in a short amount of time and with amazing success. We'll discuss tons of AI concepts, like the ingest-enrich-explore pattern, skillsets, cognitive skills, natural language processing, computer vision, and beyond.
 
## Presentation: Using Pre-Built AI to Solve Business Challenges (45 mins)

As a data-driven company, Tailwind Traders understands the importance of using Artificial Intelligence to improve business processes and delight customers. Before investing in an AI team, their existing developers were able to demonstrate some quick wins using pre-built AI technologies. In this session, we will show how you can use Azure Cognitive Services to extract insights from retail data and go into the neural networks behind computer vision. You’ll learn how it works and how to augment the pre-built AI with your own images for custom image recognition applications.
 
## Presentation: Developers Guide to AI: A Data Story (20 mins)

In this session we will show the data science process and how to apply it. From exploration of datasets to deployment of services - all applied to Tailwind Traders support ticket triage scenario. This will also take you on a very brief tour of the Azure AI Platform.


## Presentation: Start Building Machine Learning Models Faster than You Think (45 mins)

Tailwind Traders uses custom machine learning models to fix their inventory issues – without changing their Software Development Life Cycle! How? Azure Machine Learning Visual Interface. 

In this session, you’ll learn the data science process that Tailwind Traders’ uses and get an introduction to Azure Machine Learning Visual Interface. You’ll see how to find, import, and prepare data, select a machine learning algorithm, train and test the model, and deploy a complete model to an API. Get the tips, best practices, and resources you and your development team need to continue your machine learning journey, build your first model, and more.

## Presentation: Taking Models to the Next Level with Azure Machine Learning Best Practices (45 mins)

Tailwind Traders’ data science team uses natural language processing (NLP), and recently discovered how to fine-tune and build a baseline models with Automated ML.

In this session, you’ll learn what Automated ML is and why it’s so powerful, then dive into how to improve upon baseline models, using examples from the NLP best practices repository. We’ll highlight Azure Machine Learning key features and how you can apply them to your organization, including low priority compute instances, distributed training with auto scale, hyperparameter optimization, collaboration, logging, and deployment.

## Presentation: Machine Learning Operations – Applying DevOps to Data Science (45 mins)

While many companies have adopted DevOps practices to improve their software delivery, these same techniques are rarely applied to machine learning projects. Collaboration between developers and data scientists can be limited and deploying models to production in a consistent and trustworthy way is often a pipedream.

In this session, you’ll learn how to apply DevOps practices to your machine learning projects using Azure DevOps and Azure Machine Learning Service. We’ll set up automated training, scoring, and storage of versioned models and wrap the models in docker containers and deploy them to Azure Container Instances and Azure Kubernetes Service. We’ll even collect continuous feedback on model behavior so we know when to retrain.
