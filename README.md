# Learning Paths and Workshops 
The learning paths we are offering in this bootcamp are aligned with the Microsoft AI Personas and certifications. 
> If you don’t have any experience: no worries, we have preparation material for you. 

All workshops should ideally be end-to-end, so the participant can take a finished “product” home. 

 
# Learning path: Azure AI Developer 
Azure AI Engineers use Cognitive Services, Machine Learning, and Knowledge Mining to architect and implement Microsoft AI solutions involving natural language processing, speech, computer vision, bots, and agents. 

## Presentation: Making Sense of your Unstructured Data with AI (45 mins)

Tailwind Traders has a lot of legacy data that they’d like their developers to leverage in their apps – from various sources, both structured and unstructured, and including images, forms, pdf files, and several others. In this session, you'll learn how the team used Cognitive Search to make sense of this data in a short amount of time and with amazing success. We'll discuss tons of AI concepts, like the ingest-enrich-explore pattern, skillsets, cognitive skills, natural language processing, computer vision, and beyond.
 
## Presentation: Using Pre-Built AI to Solve Business Challenges (45 mins)

As a data-driven company, Tailwind Traders understands the importance of using Artificial Intelligence to improve business processes and delight customers. Before investing in an AI team, their existing developers were able to demonstrate some quick wins using pre-built AI technologies. In this session, we will show how you can use Azure Cognitive Services to extract insights from retail data and go into the neural networks behind computer vision. You’ll learn how it works and how to augment the pre-built AI with your own images for custom image recognition applications.
 
## Presentation: Developers Guide to AI: A Data Story (20 mins)

In this session we will show the data science process and how to apply it. From exploration of datasets to deployment of services - all applied to Tailwind Traders support ticket triage scenario. This will also take you on a very brief tour of the Azure AI Platform.

 
## Workshop: Creating applications that can see, hear, speak or understand - using Microsoft Cognitive Services (2 hours)

 In this workshop you will be introduced to the Microsoft Azure Cognitive Services, a range of offerings you can use to infuse intelligence and machine learning into your applications without needing to build the code from scratch. We will cover pre-trained AI APIs, such as computer vision and text analytics, that are accessed by REST protocol. nEXT we will dive into Custom AI that uses transfer learning - Microsoft Azure Custom Vision. This enables you to provide a small amount of your own data to train an image classification model. Wrapping the workshop up by building our custom trained AI into an application - using Logic Apps, this technology is ideal for building data pipeline processes that work with your machine learning models.

# Learning path: Azure Data Scientist 
Azure Data Scientists apply Azure’s machine learning techniques to train, evaluate, and deploy models that solve business problems. 

## Presentation: Start Building Machine Learning Models Faster than You Think (45 mins)

Tailwind Traders uses custom machine learning models to fix their inventory issues – without changing their Software Development Life Cycle! How? Azure Machine Learning Visual Interface. 

In this session, you’ll learn the data science process that Tailwind Traders’ uses and get an introduction to Azure Machine Learning Visual Interface. You’ll see how to find, import, and prepare data, select a machine learning algorithm, train and test the model, and deploy a complete model to an API. Get the tips, best practices, and resources you and your development team need to continue your machine learning journey, build your first model, and more.

## Presentation: Taking Models to the Next Level with Azure Machine Learning Best Practices (45 mins)

Tailwind Traders’ data science team uses natural language processing (NLP), and recently discovered how to fine-tune and build a baseline models with Automated ML.

In this session, you’ll learn what Automated ML is and why it’s so powerful, then dive into how to improve upon baseline models, using examples from the NLP best practices repository. We’ll highlight Azure Machine Learning key features and how you can apply them to your organization, including low priority compute instances, distributed training with auto scale, hyperparameter optimization, collaboration, logging, and deployment.

## Presentation: Machine Learning Operations – Applying DevOps to Data Science (45 mins)

While many companies have adopted DevOps practices to improve their software delivery, these same techniques are rarely applied to machine learning projects. Collaboration between developers and data scientists can be limited and deploying models to production in a consistent and trustworthy way is often a pipedream.

In this session, you’ll learn how to apply DevOps practices to your machine learning projects using Azure DevOps and Azure Machine Learning Service. We’ll set up automated training, scoring, and storage of versioned models and wrap the models in docker containers and deploy them to Azure Container Instances and Azure Kubernetes Service. We’ll even collect continuous feedback on model behavior so we know when to retrain.

## Is that wine good or bad? A beginner tutorial on how to build a binary classification machine learning model with no code using Azure Machine Learning Visual Interface (1 hour)

In this workshop you will be introduced to the data science process for building custom machine learning models using Azure Machine Learning Visual Interface. We will cover how to find, import, and prepare data, selecting a machine learning algorithm, training and testing the model, and how to deploy a complete model to an API. Lastly we will discuss some common data science beginner gotchas and provide additional resources to continue your machine learning journey!

## Learn how to train high accuracy machine learning models using automated machine learning (1 hour)

Intelligent experiences powered by AI can seem like magic to users. Developing them, however, is cumbersome involving a series of sequential and interconnected decisions along the way that are pretty time consuming. What if there was an automated service that identifies the best machine learning pipelines for a given problem/data? Automated machine learning does exactly that! Learn how to quickly and efficiently build high accuracy ml models for classification, regression and forecasting scenarios using code and code-free pathways.
